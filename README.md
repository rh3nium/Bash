<b>Bash</b> (short for <b>Bourne Again Shell</b>) is a command-line language and scripting shell used primarily on Unix and Linux systems to interact with the operating system and automate tasks. It serves both as an interactive shell—where users can execute commands, manage files, and control processes—and as a scripting language that allows writing programs (called shell scripts) to perform repetitive or complex operations efficiently.
- Bash supports features like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions, making it powerful for system administration, automation, and DevOps workflows.
- Bash is the default shell in most Linux distributions and is widely used for server management, build scripts, and automation pipelines.
